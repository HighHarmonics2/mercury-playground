// === TUTORIAL 11 ===
// instead of a 1 or 0 in the play method, 
// we can also use a floating-point value that represents
// a probability percentage that the sound will or will not play

new sample hat_909 time(1/16) play(0.6)
// plays 60% of the time

new sample kick_909 time(1/4) play(0.9)
// plays 90% of the time

// now try some different percentages with values between 0 and 1
