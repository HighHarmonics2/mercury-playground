// === TUTORIAL 11 ===
// Instead of a 1 (100%) or 0 (0%) in the play method, 
// we can also use a decimal-point value that represents
// a percentage of probability that the sound will play
set tempo 86

new sample hat_808 time(1/16) play(0.6)
// plays 60% of the time

new sample kick_808_long time(1/8) play(0.2)
// plays 90% of the time

new sample snare_808 time(1/2)

// now try some different percentages with values between 0 and 1
