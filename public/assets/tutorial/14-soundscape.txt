// === TUTORIAL 14 ===
// we can combine multiple sounds with different 
// slow speeds to create some kind of soundscape

new sample gong_hi time(4) speed(0.3)
new sample bowl_hi time(3) speed(0.125)
new sample drone_cymbal time(7) speed(0.5)
// now experiment with different time and speed values
// maybe even use lists for the speed to create some variation
