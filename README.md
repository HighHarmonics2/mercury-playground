## üìü About 

**Mercury is a minimal and human-readable language for the live coding of algorithmic electronic music.** 

All elements of the language are designed around making code more accessible and less obfuscating for the audience. This motivation stretches down to the coding style itself which uses clear descriptive names for functions and a clear syntax. Furthermore the editor is restricted to 30 lines of code, keeping all code always visible. Mercury provides the performer with an extensive library of algorithms to generate or transform numbersequences that can modulate parameters, such as melody and rhythm, over time. The environment produces sound in conjunction with visuals. Besides looking at the code, the audience is also looking at the visuals that are reactive to the sound or generated by the sound.

It is named after te planet Mercury. Mercury rules the creation and expression of our mental processes. The planet implores us to express ourselves. Mercury is about a quick wit, quick thinking. It lets us move from one thing to the next.

Mercury is orginally programmed in the Cycling'74 Max8 node-based creative coding environment. This "lite" version is build for the browser using the Tone.js framework.

Mercury uses the [Total Serialism NodeJS](https://github.com/tmhglnd/total-serialism#total-serialism) package available on npmjs.com. This package contains an extensive library of algorithmic composition methods.

## üéÆ Features Overview

Quick access to playback of samples and change timing and tempo of samples or synthesizers

```java
set tempo 89

new sample kick_909 time(1/4)
new sample hat_909 time(3/16)
```

Make rhythmic patterns with sequences of numbers and probabilities

```java
ring loBeat [1 0 0 1 0.5]
ring hiBeat [0 1 0.2 0]

new sample tabla_lo time(1/8) play(loBeat)
new sample tabla_hi time(1/8) play(hiBeat)
```

<!-- Generate psuedorandom melodic content for a synthesizer in a range and set a scale

```java
set scale minor d
set randomSeed 31415

ring melody random(16 0 24)

new synth saw note(melody) time(1/16) shape(4 100)
```

Design sounds with various effects

```java
new sample chimes time(2) speed(-0.25) fx(reverb 0.3 15) fx(drive 10) fx(lfo 1/8 sine)
```

Easily give multiple instruments the same effects

```java
new sample chimes time(2)
new sample harp_down time(3)
new sample gong_lo time(5)

set all fx(lfo 1/16) fx(delay) fx(reverb 0.5 11)
```

Generate sequences algorithmically to compose complex structures and choose from an extensive library of algorithms to work with

```java
set scale minor a 

ring rhythm euclidean(32 13)

ring melody spread(5 0 24)
ring melody palinedrome(melody)
ring melody clone(melody 0 5 7 3)
ring melody lace(melody melody)

new synth triangle note(melody 1) shape(1 80) play(rhythm)
```

Control external midi devices or send midi to other applications and use clock sync

```java
set midi getPorts
//=> prints the available devices to the console
new midi "Your Awesome Midi Device" time(1/4) note(7 1) length(100) sync(on)
```

Control other environments via OSC-messages

```java
ring params [0.25 0.5 0.75]

new emitter osc address(yourDevice) theParam(params) time(1/4)

// emits => /yourDevice/theParam 0.25
//          /yourDevice/theParam 0.5
//          /yourDevice/theParam 0.75
//          /yourDevice/theParam 0.25
//          etc...
```

Easily control parameters in Mercury via external OSC-messages

```java
new synth triangle fx(reverb /extOSC/verbAmount) fx(filter low /extOSC/cutoff 0.4) time(1) shape(1 1000)
``` -->

**AND MANY MORE (TO COME...)**

Currently the playground does not have the full functionality of the original Mercury environment.

## üî≠ Vision / Goals

This subset of Mercury was designed to use as a teaching environment for:
- introduction to (electronic) music
- algorithmic composition
- sequencing and pattern generating
- sound design
- creative coding and live coding
- sampling and beat making

## üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª Collaborative Coding

It is now possible to code together in Mercury using the amazing [**Flok**](https://flok.clic.cf/) live coding environment in the browser.

- [Start coding together here](https://tmhglnd.github.io/mercury/collaborate.html)

## üöÄ Install

üòé No need for installing! You can start coding immediately here:
[**https://mercury-sketch.glitch.me/**](https://mercury-sketch.glitch.me/)

ü§ì If you want to run and develop the application locally:

`$ git clone http://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury-playground`

`$ npm install`

`$ npm run build`

`$ npm start`

`$ open -a Google\ Chrome http://localhost:3000`

While developing: `npm run watch`

## üìñ Documentation

Full explanation of all the possibilities in Mercury:

- [Open the documentation](https://tmhglnd.github.io/mercury/table-of-content.html)

## üíª System Requirements

## üéµ Sounds

Many sounds in Mercury are downloaded from [freesound.org](http://www.freesound.org) and are licensed with Creative Commons Attribution or Creative Commons 0 licenses. If not downloaded from freesound it is made sure that the license allows to redistribute the sounds via the Mercury environment and that you can use them in your projects. A list of all the available sounds and the original sample can be found here:

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Visuals

You can load Hydra visuals by pasting the compressed url code in the textarea below the Editor. Removing the link will disable the visual rendering. [Hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/) is a Live coding visual synthesizer developed Olivia Jack.
