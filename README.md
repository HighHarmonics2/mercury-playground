## 📟 About 

**Mercury is a minimal and human-readable language for the live coding of algorithmic electronic music.** 

All elements of the language are designed around making code more accessible and less obfuscating for the audience. This motivation stretches down to the coding style itself which uses clear descriptive names for functions and a clear syntax. Furthermore the editor is restricted to 30 lines of code, keeping all code always visible. Mercury provides the performer with an extensive library of algorithms to generate or transform numbersequences that can modulate parameters, such as melody and rhythm, over time. The environment produces sound in conjunction with visuals. Besides looking at the code, the audience is also looking at the visuals that are reactive to the sound or generated by the sound.

It is named after te planet Mercury. Mercury rules the creation and expression of our mental processes. The planet implores us to express ourselves. Mercury is about a quick wit, quick thinking. It lets us move from one thing to the next.

Mercury is orginally programmed in the Cycling'74 Max8 node-based creative coding environment. This "lite" version is build for the browser using the Tone.js framework.

Mercury uses the [Total Serialism NodeJS](https://github.com/tmhglnd/total-serialism#total-serialism) package available on npmjs.com. This package contains an extensive library of algorithmic composition methods.

## 🎮 Features Overview

Quick access to playback of samples and change timing and tempo of samples or synthesizers

```java
set tempo 89

new sample kick_909 time(1/4)
new sample hat_909 time(3/16)
```

Make rhythmic patterns with sequences of numbers and probabilities

```java
list loBeat [1 0 0 1 0.5]
list hiBeat [0 1 0.2 0]

new sample tabla_lo time(1/8) play(loBeat)
new sample tabla_hi time(1/8) play(hiBeat)
```

Generate psuedorandom melodic content for a synthesizer in a range and set a scale

```java
set scale minor a
set randomSeed 31415

list melody random(16 0 24)

new synth saw note(melody) time(1/16) shape(4 100)
```

Generate sequences algorithmically to compose complex structures and choose from an extensive library of algorithms to work with

```java
set tempo 132
list rhythm euclid(32 13)

list melody spread(5 0 24)
list melody palindrome(melody)
list melody clone(melody 0 5 7 3)
list melody lace(melody melody)

new synth triangle time(1/16) note(melody 1) shape(1 80) play(rhythm)
```

Design sounds with various effects (and upload your own sounds to use)

```java
new sample chimes time(2) speed(0.25) fx(reverb 0.3 15) fx(drive 10) fx(shift 3 0.5)
```

Easily give multiple instruments the same effects

```java
new sample chimes time(2)
new sample harp_down time(3)
new sample gong_lo time(5)

set all fx(reverb 0.5 11) fx(drive 1.5) fx(filter low 2000 0.6)
```

Sync audio loops to the tempo of your music

```java
set tempo 97

new loop amen time(1)
new sample kick_house time(1/4)
```

Control external midi devices or applications by sending midi and cc <!--and use clock sync-->

```java
new midi "Your Awesome Midi Device" time(1/16) note(7 1) name(mDev)
    set mDev length(1/16) gain(0.8) chord(off)
    set mDev cc(10 [20 50 100])
```

Sequence Hyrda visuals with instruments (experimental)

```java
list hydras ['osc(10,0.1,2).out()' 'osc(20,-0.5,5).out()' 'osc(5,1,12).out()']

new sample kick_min time(1/16) play([1 0 0 1 0]) visual(hydras)
```
<!-- 
Control other environments via OSC-messages

```java
ring params [0.25 0.5 0.75]

new emitter osc address(yourDevice) theParam(params) time(1/4)

// emits => /yourDevice/theParam 0.25
//          /yourDevice/theParam 0.5
//          /yourDevice/theParam 0.75
//          /yourDevice/theParam 0.25
//          etc...
```
-->

Easily control parameters in Mercury via external OSC-messages (only when running [localhost](#-install))

```java
new synth triangle fx(reverb '/synth/verb') fx(filter low '/synth/cutoff' 0.4) time(1) shape(1 'synth/length')
```

**AND MANY MORE (TO COME...)**

The playground does not have exactly the same functionality of the original Mercury environment running in Max8. See below the differences. You may also encounter some discrepancies in syntax. Please support issues if you find any.

## 🔭 Vision / Goals

This subset of Mercury was designed to use as a teaching environment for:
- introduction to (electronic) music
- algorithmic composition
- sequencing and pattern generating
- sound design
- creative coding and live coding
- sampling and beat making

⭐️ *watch and star this repo to keep up-to-date with the latest changes whenever they're made*

## 👩‍💻👨‍💻 Collaborative Coding

It is possible to code together in Mercury using the amazing [**Flok**](https://flok.clic.cf/) live coding editor in the browser together with the Mercury standalone version in Max8.

- [Start coding together here](https://tmhglnd.github.io/mercury/collaborate.html)

## 🚀 Install

😎 **No need for installing!** You can start coding immediately in the browser:
[**https://mercury.timohoogland.com/**](https://mercury.timohoogland.com/)

### 💻 Running without internet

🤓 If you want to run the application locally (for using without internet, or using the OSC functionality or when developing extra features):

In the Terminal navigate to the folder you want to install Mercury. Then run:

`git clone http://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury-playground`

Navigate to the cloned folder with:

`cd mercury-playground`

Then install all the dependecies:

`npm install` (make sure you have NodeJS v18 installed, check by running `node -v`)

Then build your local version:

`npm run build` (or `$ npm run watch` while developing)

Now start the local server:

`npm start`

Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. Once connected the Terminal will print:

```
Connected yH0SGEdRHbZD1IACAAAB
Receive messages from Mercury on port 9000
Send messages to Mercury on port 8000
```

Mercury can now receive OSC-messages on port `8000`

## 📖 Documentation

Full explanation of all the possibilities in Mercury:

- [Open the documentation](https://tmhglnd.github.io/mercury/table-of-content.html)

*NB: The Mercury Playground still lacks some functionalities, see the list above*

## 💻 System Requirements

Any laptop/desktop that runs a browser like Chrome, Brave or Firefox.

## 🎵 Sounds

Many sounds in Mercury are downloaded from [freesound.org](http://www.freesound.org) and are licensed with Creative Commons Attribution or Creative Commons 0 licenses. If not downloaded from freesound it is made sure that the license allows to redistribute the sounds via the Mercury environment and that you can use them in your projects. A list of all the available sounds and the original sample can be found here:

- [List of sounds and credits](https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury/blob/master/mercury_ide/media/README.md)

### Use your own sounds

If you like to include your own sounds you can click `Add sounds` on the bottom right of the editor. When you run the application locally you can also replace or add any sounds to the `public/assets/samples` folder and run `npm run build`, this creates a new database of soundfiles in `src/data/samples.json`.

## ⚡️ Visuals

You can load Hydra visuals by pasting the compressed url code in the textarea below the Editor. Removing the link will disable the visual rendering. [Hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/) is a Live coding visual synthesizer developed Olivia Jack.
