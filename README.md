## 📟 About 

**Mercury is a minimal and human-readable language for the live coding of algorithmic electronic music.** 

All elements of the language are designed around making code more accessible and less obfuscating for the audience. This motivation stretches down to the coding style itself which uses clear descriptive names for functions and a clear syntax. Furthermore the editor is restricted to 30 lines of code, keeping all code always visible. Mercury provides the performer with an extensive library of algorithms to generate or transform numbersequences that can modulate parameters, such as melody and rhythm, over time. The environment produces sound in conjunction with visuals. Besides looking at the code, the audience is also looking at the visuals that are reactive to the sound or generated by the sound.

It is named after te planet Mercury. Mercury rules the creation and expression of our mental processes. The planet implores us to express ourselves. Mercury is about a quick wit, quick thinking. It lets us move from one thing to the next.

Mercury is orginally programmed in the Cycling'74 Max8 node-based creative coding environment. This "lite" version is build for the browser using the Tone.js framework.

Mercury uses the [Total Serialism NodeJS](https://github.com/tmhglnd/total-serialism#total-serialism) package available on npmjs.com. This package contains an extensive library of algorithmic composition methods.

// emits => /yourDevice/theParam 0.25
//          /yourDevice/theParam 0.5
//          /yourDevice/theParam 0.75
//          /yourDevice/theParam 0.25
//          etc...
```
-->

Easily control parameters in Mercury via external OSC-messages (only when running [localhost](#-install))

```java
new synth triangle fx(reverb '/synth/verb') fx(filter low '/synth/cutoff' 0.4) time(1) shape(1 'synth/length')
```

**AND MANY MORE (TO COME...)**

The browser playground does not have exactly the same functionality as the original Mercury environment running in Max8. See below the 
differences. You may also encounter some discrepancies in syntax and in the documentation. Please report issues if you find any so they can be fixed. Every item with a `*` is only available in the browser version.

## 👩‍💻👨‍💻 Collaborative Coding

You can code together in Mercury using the amazing [**Flok**](https://flok.cc/) live coding editor in the browser together with the **Mercury Playground** or the **standalone version** in Max8.

- [Follow the instructions here](https://tmhglnd.github.io/mercury/collaborate.html)

## 🚀 Install

😎 **No need for installing!** You can start coding immediately in the browser:
[**https://mercury.timohoogland.com/**](https://mercury.timohoogland.com/)

### 💻 Running without internet

🤓 If you want to run the application locally (for using without internet, or using the OSC functionality or when developing extra features):

Make sure you have NodeJS installed [for Mac](https://nodejs.org/en) or [for Windows](https://nodejs.org/en)

In the Terminal navigate to the folder you want to install Mercury. Then run: `git clone http://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury-playground`

Navigate to the cloned folder with: `cd mercury-playground`

Then install all the dependecies: `npm install` (make sure you have NodeJS v18 installed, check by running `node -v`)

Then build your local version: `npm run build` (or `npm run watch` while developing)

Now start the local server: `npm start`, open a browser and go to [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080). 

Once connected the Terminal will print:

```
Connected yH0SGEdRHbZD1IACAAAB
Receive messages from Mercury on port 2440
Send messages to Mercury on port 4880
```

Mercury can now receive OSC-messages on port `4880` *(the portnumber is chosen to not interfere with many other default portnumbers. The number is the diameter in kilometers of the planet Mercury)*

## 📖 Documentation

- [Open the documentation](https://tmhglnd.github.io/mercury/table-of-content.html)

**NB: There are still some differences between the Mercury Playground and the Max8 version. If you find any discrepancies please report an issue**

## 💻 System Requirements

Any laptop/desktop that runs a chromium based browser like Chrome or Brave.

## 🎵 Sounds

Most sounds in Mercury are downloaded from [freesound.org](http://www.freesound.org) and are licensed with Creative Commons Attribution or Creative Commons 0 licenses. If not downloaded from freesound it is made sure that the license allows to redistribute the sounds via the Mercury environment and that you can use them in your projects. A list of all the available sounds and the original sample can be found here:

- [List of sounds and credits](https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury/blob/master/mercury_ide/media/README.md)

### Use your own sounds

If you like to include your own sounds you can click `Add sounds` on the bottom right of the editor. When you run the application locally you can also replace or add any sounds to the `public/assets/samples` folder and run `npm run build`, this creates a new database of soundfiles in `src/data/samples.json`.

## ⚡️ Visuals

You can load Hydra visuals by pasting the compressed url code in the textarea below the Editor. Removing the link will disable the visual rendering. [Hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/) is a Live coding visual synthesizer developed Olivia Jack.
